## Project Description
- This API displays articles of clothing and contains one model with all four CRUD routes (outfits).
- Employs the ME and N of a full stack MERN application (Mongo, Express, and Node).
- Front end deployed here (hopefully these backend servers stay up): http://stitchappjrfrontend.herokuapp.com/.
- Back end deployed here: http://stitchappjr.herokuapp.com/outfits - endpoints are /shirts,/pants,/jackets,/outfits.
- Time to complete: <24 hours.

## Process
- Jade and I used paired-programming principles to divide work, switching typer/navigator every two commits.
- Building out the API was easy enough, we began by designing 4 schemas, seeded base data, and wrote 4 controllers.
- Next came the React front-end - the R of MERN - which we divided the same way.
- The front end uses AJAX calls to our backend API, which retrieves clothing data as well as CRUDS an outfit collection dependent on what articles of clothing the user selects.
- React Tech Used: Hooks, Routes, Links, Switches, Functional components exclusively.

## Challenges
- Due to our limited time window, Jade and I settled on a simplified form of our app, with static articles (3 of each type), which resulted in an overall boring user landscape. This could be improved upon easily with a better base seed or a third party API seed.
- React stateful issues came and went quickly, but they did come. 
- Minor styling bumps that required slight manipulation to stay mobile-friendly .
